# GGHYK-M-Implementation-and-Documentation
A documented implementation and optimization of the GGHYK-M cryptosystem in Python.


The TEST long.txt is the Declaration of Independence for the testing of the algorithm.
The ciphertext.txt is the output of characters for the encryption.
The adjustments.txt keeps track of the adjustments for each index of the ciphertext in order for decryption to do the reverse of the changes that allowed for character output.
The decrypted_text.txt is the output of the algorithm for the decryption.
